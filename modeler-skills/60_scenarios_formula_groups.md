# Scenarios and Formula Groups

Goal: manage different formula behaviors across scenarios cleanly.

## 1) Formula groups per scenario
- Use **Formula Groups** to define alternative logic for specific scenarios.
- Verify which scenarios are attached to each formula group.

## 2) Editing formulas in scenarios
- Edit formulas inside the scenario context to avoid unintended changes.
- Track changes and validate outputs across base vs scenario.

## 3) Checklist
- Formula groups documented and named
- Scenario‑specific logic isolated
- Output validated against base scenario
