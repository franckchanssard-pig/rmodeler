# Libraries and Multi‑App Modeling

Goal: reuse building blocks and avoid duplicated logic.

## 1) Libraries overview
- Use **Libraries** to share blocks and views across applications.
- Libraries reduce duplication and keep logic consistent.

## 2) Sharing blocks safely
- Sharing a block also shares its **dimensions**.
- Access rights are **not** automatically granted when a block is shared.
- Use clear naming to indicate shared vs local blocks.

## 3) Workflow tips
- Prefer sharing **Blocks** for calculations; share **Views** for UI reuse.
- Document ownership and change policy for shared blocks.
